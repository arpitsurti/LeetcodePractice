    /*771. Jewels and Stones
     * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
        Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

        Example 1:
        Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
        Output: 3
        
        Example 2:
        Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
        Output: 0

        Constraints:
        1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
        jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
        All the characters of jewels are unique.
